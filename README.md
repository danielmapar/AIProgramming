# AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Program

## Introduction to AI Programming

### Lesson 2: Data Types and Operators

* `**`: Exponentiation
    * `3 ** 2`: 3 to the power of 2
* `//`: Integer division
    * `7 // 2 == 3`: It rounds down the answer to an integer
        * `-5 // 2 == -3` and `5 // 2 == 2` 

* ![reserved](./images/reserved.PNG)

* Note that this code uses scientific notation to define large numbers. `4.445e8` is equal to `4.445 * 10 ** 8` which is equal to `444500000.0`.

#### Integers and Floats

* Because the float, or approximation, for 0.1 is actually slightly more than 0.1, when we add several of them together we can see the difference between the mathematically correct answer and the one that Python creates.

    * ```python
        >>> print(.1 + .1 + .1 == .3)
        False
        ```

### Lesson 3: Data Structures

#### Slicing a list

* You saw that we can pull more than one value from a list at a time by using slicing. When using slicing, it is important to remember that the `lower` index is `inclusive` and the `upper` index is `exclusive`.

* ```python
    >>> list_of_random_things = [1, 3.4, 'a string', True]
    >>> list_of_random_things[1:2]
    [3.4]
    ```

* will only return 3.4 in a list. Notice this is still different than just indexing a single element, because you get a list back with this indexing. The colon tells us to go from the starting value on the left of the colon up to, but not including, the element on the right.

* If you know that you want to start at the beginning, of the list you can also leave out this value.
    * ```python
        >>> list_of_random_things[:2]
        [1, 3.4]
        ```

* or to return all of the elements to the end of the list, we can leave off a final element.
    * ```python
        >>> list_of_random_things[1:]
        [3.4, 'a string', True]
        ```

#### Mutability and Order

* Mutability is about whether or not we can change an object once it has been created. If an object (like a list or string) can be changed (like a list can), then it is called mutable. However, if an object cannot be changed with creating a completely new object (like strings), then the object is considered immutable.

    * List is mutable and ordered
    * Tuple is immutable and ordered
        * ```(1,2,3,4)```
    * Set is mutable and has no duplicates
    * Dictionary for mutable objects that store mapping of unique keys to values.

* The == operator compares by checking for equality: If these cats were Python objects and we’d compare them with the == operator, we’d get “both cats are equal” as an answer.

* The is operator, however, compares identities: If we compared our cats with the is operator, we’d get “these are two different cats” as an answer.

### Lesson 4: Control Flow

* Zip: 
    * ![zip](./images/zip.PNG)
    * ```python
        letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
        nums = [1, 2, 3]

        for letter, num in zip(letters, nums):
            print("{}: {}".format(letter, num))
        ```
    * In addition to zipping two lists together, you can also unzip a list into tuples using an asterisk.
        * ```python
            some_list = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
            letters, nums = zip(*some_list)
            ```

* Enumerate
    * ![enumerate](./images/enumerate.PNG)
    * enumerate is a built in function that returns an iterator of tuples containing indices and values of a list. You'll often use this when you want the index along with each element of an iterable in a loop.
        * ```python
            letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
            for i, letter in enumerate(letters):
                print(i, letter)
            ```

* List Comprehensions
    * ![list-comprehensions](./images/list_comprehensions.PNG) 

### Lesson 5: Functions

* Lambda Expressions

    * ![lambda](./images/lambda.PNG) 
    * `double = lambda x: x * 2`

* Iterator: An object that represents a stream of data
    * The `yield` key-works is what differentiate a normal object from an iterator object
* Generator: A function that creates an iterator

```python
def my_enumerate(iterable, start=0):
    count = start
    for element in iterable:
        yield count, element
        count += 1

for i, lesson in my_enumerate(lessons, 1):
    print("Lesson {}: {}".format(i, lesson))

def chunker(iterable, size):
    """Yield successive chunks from iterable of length size."""
    for i in range(0, len(iterable), size):
        yield iterable[i:i + size]

for chunk in chunker(range(25), 4):
    print(list(chunk))

sq_list = [x**2 for x in range(10)]  # this produces a list of squares

sq_iterator = (x**2 for x in range(10))  # this produces an iterator of squares
```

### Lesson 6: Scripting

* ```python
    names = input("Enter names separated by commas: ").title().split(",")
    assignments = input("Enter assignment counts separated by commas: ").split(",")
    grades = input("Enter grades separated by commas: ").split(",")

    message = "Hi {},\n\nThis is a reminder that you have {} assignments left to \
    submit before you can graduate. You're current grade is {} and can increase \
    to {} if you submit all assignments before the due date.\n\n"

    for name, assignment, grade in zip(names, assignments, grades):
        print(message.format(name, assignment, grade, int(grade) + int(assignment)*2))
    ```

* ```python
    import useful_functions
    useful_functions.add_five([1, 2, 3, 4])

    import useful_functions as uf
    uf.add_five([1, 2, 3, 4])
    ```

* Using a main block

    * To avoid running executable statements in a script when it's imported as a module in another script, include these lines in an if __name__ == "__main__" block. Or alternatively, include them in a function called main() and call this in the if main block.

    * Whenever we run a script like this, Python actually sets a special built-in variable called __name__ for any module. When we run a script, Python recognizes this module as the main program, and sets the __name__ variable for this module to the string "__main__". For any modules that are imported in this script, this built-in __name__ variable is just set to the name of that module. Therefore, the condition if __name__ == "__main__"is just checking whether this module is the main program.

    * Try running `demo.py`

* Techniques for Importing Modules

    * There are other variants of import statements that are useful in different situations.

        * `from module_name import object_name`

        * `from module_name import first_object, second_object`

        * `import module_name as new_name`

        * `from module_name import object_name as new_name`

        * `from module_name import *`
            * **Do not do this**


### Lesson 7: Intro to Object-Oriented Programming

* ```python
    class Shirt:

    def __init__(self, shirt_color, shirt_size, shirt_style, shirt_price):
        self._price = shirt_price

    def get_price(self):
      return self._price

    def set_price(self, new_price):
      self._price = new_price


    shirt_one = Shirt('yellow', 'M', 'long-sleeve', 15)
    print(shirt_one.get_price())
    shirt_one.set_price(10)
    ```

*  A docstring is a type of comment that describes how a Python module, function, class or method works. Docstrings, therefore, are not unique to object-oriented programming. This section of the course is merely reminding you to use docstrings and to comment your code. It's not just going to help you understand and maintain your code. It will also make you a better job candidate.

* ```python
    class Pants:
    """The Pants class represents an article of clothing sold in a store
    """

    def __init__(self, color, waist_size, length, price):
        """Method for initializing a Pants object

        Args: 
            color (str)
            waist_size (int)
            length (int)
            price (float)

        Attributes:
            color (str): color of a pants object
            waist_size (str): waist size of a pants object
            length (str): length of a pants object
            price (float): price of a pants object
        """

        self.color = color
        self.waist_size = waist_size
        self.length = length
        self.price = price

    def change_price(self, new_price):
        """The change_price method changes the price attribute of a pants object

        Args: 
            new_price (float): the new price of the pants object

        Returns: None

        """
        self.price = new_price

    def discount(self, percentage):
        """The discount method outputs a discounted price of a pants object

        Args:
            percentage (float): a decimal representing the amount to discount

        Returns:
            float: the discounted price
        """
        return self.price * (1 - percentage)
    ```

* Magic methods 
    * `__init__` is one
    * `__add__` and `__repr__` are also examples
    * Those methods let you override and customize default Python behaviour
        * `__add__` overrides the behaviour of the plus sign
        * `__repr__` when the only code in a line is a variable
